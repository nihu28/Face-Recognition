# Face Recognition System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a **Face Recognition System** using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles image datasets, including resizing and normalization.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning models for face recognition.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `sklearn`
